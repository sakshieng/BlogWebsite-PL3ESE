She writes: “At every company I’ve worked at, I’ve ripped out the performance review systems and looked for new ways of solving what people say are the points of performance reviews. To me, ensuring employees hear from their managers on how they’re doing relative to goals should happen regularly instead of once or twice a year.
                    As you contemplate what’s next for you, I’m curious: To level up in life, do you need to innovate or do you need to problem solve? If you write about this, please let me know!
